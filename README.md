# Arduino

This repository holds some of the projects I worked on as a coder in SRM Team Robocon.

OMNI-DIRECTIONAL ROBOT: 
The most notable project I worked on was a robot with a chassis consisting of 3 swedish wheels at 120 degrees from one another. This allowed the robot to move freely in any direction on the ground with the right combination of motors rotating in the right direction.
