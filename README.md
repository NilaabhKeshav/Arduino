# Arduino

This repository holds some of the projects I worked on as a coder in SRM Team Robocon.

OMNI-DIRECTIONAL ROBOT: 
The most notable project I worked on was a robot with a chassis consisting of 3 swedish wheels at 120 degrees from one another. This allowed the robot to move freely in any direction on the ground with the right combination of motors rotating in the right direction (determined by vector resolution).

CONTROLS:
Created separate programs for the robot to be controlled by a simple wired joystick as well as an old wired PS2 controller.

MOTORS:
Worked with various motors and motor drivers to find the most suitable one in various situations.

COMMUNICATIONS AND MODULES:
Worked on different communication types like i2c, UART, SPI,etc. Also worked on modules and sensors like Ultrasonic, Infrared, Photoresistors, Potmeter,etc.
